# Liver-Disease-Probability
Here we have a dataset of 583 patients who were diagnosed for the liver disease. Out of them, 416 patients were tested positive and 167 were tested negative for the liver disease. The data is collected from the North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. We need to find out what is the probability of a patient having the disease. We also need to find out what is the probability of a patient having the disease given that the patient is 

- a juvenile i.e. a person whose age is less than 18 years.

- an adult i.e. a person whose age is greater than or equal to 18 years but less than 50 years.

- an elderly i.e. a person whose age is at least 50 years.

We also need to create a binomial distribution model to check what is the probability distribution of a patient having a disease.

The `Dataset` column is a class label used to divide groups into liver patients (liver disease) or not (no disease). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.


Now we will use these patient records to determine which patients have liver disease and which ones do not.
